I am a Professor of Computer Science at Texas A&M University-Commerce (East Texas A&M University). 

Before joining my current institution in 2012, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher in the Scientific Data Management Research Group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (2010–2011) and served as an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Lock Haven University of Pennsylvania (2011–2012). I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Minnesota–Twin Cities, where I was mentored by Dr. Jon B. Weissman and Dr. Abhishek Chandra. Prior to pursuing my doctoral studies, I spent over a decade as a research staff member at ETRI, a national research lab in Korea, contributing to projects on broadband networking systems, network management, and network security.
