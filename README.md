I am a Professor of Computer Science at East Texas A&M University. Prior to joining the current university in 2012, I was an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the Lock Haven University of Pennsylvania, after my postdoctoral research at Scientific Data Management Research Group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, under the guidance of Dr. Jon B. Weissman and Dr. Abhishek Chandra<. Prior to that, I was a senior researcher at ETRI, a national lab in Korea, and mainly worked on broadband networking system/network management and network security over ten years.
